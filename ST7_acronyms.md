\+ may provide commission that helps with cashflow                        
\- cedes the same proportion of low and high variance risks               
\- cedes the same proportion of risks, irrespective of size               
\- passed a share of any profit to the reinsurer                          
\- is unsuitable for unlimited covers

\+ is useful for classes where wide variation can occur in the size of risks   
\+ helps to spread risks
