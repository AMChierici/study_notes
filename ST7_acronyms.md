### Conditions for insurability - Ch 2 - FIVE PUMPS

**\*F**inancially and reasonable quantifiable risk  
**I**ndividual risk events should be independent of each other

**\*P**olicyholder has an interest in the risk, to distinguish between insurance and gambling

### Advantages / disadvantages of quota share - Ch 5

\+ spreads risk, increasing capacity and encouraging reciprocal business  
\+ directly improves the solvency ratio (without losing market share)     
\+ is administratively simple                                             
\+ may provide commission that helps with cashflow                        
\- cedes the same proportion of low and high variance risks               
\- cedes the same proportion of risks, irrespective of size               
\- passed a share of any profit to the reinsurer                          
\- is unsuitable for unlimited covers

\+ enables the insurer to fine-tune its experience                            
\+ enables the insurer to write larger risks                                  
\+ is useful for classes where wide variation can occur in the size of risks   
\+ helps to spread risks                                                      
\+ may provide commission that helps with cashflow                            
\- requires more complex administration                                       
\- is unsuitable for unlimited covers and personal lines cover                

### Advantages / disadvantages of excess of loss - Ch 5

\+ allows the insurer to accept risks that could lead to large claims  
\+ reduces risk of insolvency from a large claim, an aggregation of claims, or a catastrophe  
\+ reduces claim fluctuations (and so smooths results)  
\+ helps to make more efficient use of capital  
\- the insurer pays a premium to the insurer that, in the long run, if priced accurately, will be greater than the expected recoveries under the treaty

\+ **S**erves as starting point for a number of other methods, e.g. Bornhuetter-Ferguson  

\- **U**nusual experience distorts results (e.g. very good or very bad past claims experience)  
\- **R**ecent cohorts may have limited use of chain ladder, particularly for long-tailed classes  
\- **I**mpacted potentially significantly by usual features in data so considerable care needed
