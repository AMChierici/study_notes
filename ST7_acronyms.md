### Advantages / disadvantages of excess of loss - Ch 5

\+ allows the insurer to accept risks that could lead to large claims

\+ reduces claim fluctuations (and so smooths results)  
\+ helps to make more efficient use of capital  
\- the insurer pays a premium to the insurer that, in the long run, if priced accurately, will be greater than the expected recoveries under the treaty
