### Conditions for insurability - Ch 2 - FIVE PUMPS

**\*F**inancially and reasonable quantifiable risk  
**I**ndividual risk events should be independent of each other  
**V**ariance reduced by pooling large numbers of similar risks, and hence acheive more certainty  
**E**xisting statistical data / information sufficient to quantify risk  
    
**\*P**olicyholder has an interest in the risk, to distinguish between insurance and gambling  
**U**ltimate liability should be limited

### Advantages / disadvantages of quota share - Ch 5

\+ spreads risk, increasing capacity and encouraging reciprocal business  
\+ directly improves the solvency ratio (without losing market share)     
\+ is administratively simple                                             
\+ may provide commission that helps with cashflow                        
\- cedes the same proportion of low and high variance risks               
\- cedes the same proportion of risks, irrespective of size               
\- passed a share of any profit to the reinsurer                          
\- is unsuitable for unlimited covers                                     

### Advantages / disadvantages of surplus - Ch 5
                                                                              
\+ enables the insurer to fine-tune its experience                            
\+ enables the insurer to write larger risks                                  
\+ is useful for classes where wide variation can occur in the size of risks   
\+ helps to spread risks                                                      
\+ may provide commission that helps with cashflow                            
\- requires more complex administration                                       
\- is unsuitable for unlimited covers and personal lines cover                

### Advantages / disadvantages of excess of loss - Ch 5

\+ allows the insurer to accept risks that could lead to large claims  
\+ reduces risk of insolvency from a large claim, an aggregation of claims, or a catastrophe  
\+ reduces claim fluctuations (and so smooths results)  
\+ helps to make more efficient use of capital  
\- the insurer pays a premium to the insurer that, in the long run, if priced accurately, will be greater than the expected recoveries under the treaty

### Strengths and weaknesses of the chain ladder method - Ch 13 - VUMES URI

\+ **V**ariety of data sets can have chain ladder appied  
\+ **U**ltimates can be projected provided data can be arranged into a development triangle  
\+ **M**odifications to the method are easy to allow for data distortions  
\+ **E**asy to relate results back to pattern of development and method conceptually straightforward  
\+ **S**erves as starting point for a number of other methods, e.g. Bornhuetter-Ferguson  

\- **U**nusual experience distorts results (e.g. very good or very bad past claims experience)  
\- **R**ecent cohorts may have limited use of chain ladder, particularly for long-tailed classes  
\- **I**mpacted potentially significantly by usual features in data so considerable care needed  

### Strengths and weaknesses of expected loss ratio method - Ch 13 - N UPBRAID

\+ **N**ot distorted by anomalous data  

\- **U**LRs for prior years ma be understated or overstated because of flucuations in experience  
\- **P**remium rate changes are often only for renewed business and not for new business  
\- **B**enchmarks used may not be appropriate  
\- **R**eplicates past biases if loss ratios are derived from past years  
\- **A**ssumptions underlying can be subjective, particularly when based on soft information such as underwriter's opinion  
\- **I**gnores pattern of claims development to data  
\- **D**ifficult to adjust for large claims  

### Strengths and weakness of Bornhuetter-Ferguson method - CA C - Ch 13

\+ **C**an be used when claims data is at a very early stage of development  
\+ **A**t extreme, when no claims incurrecy, BCL gives 0 ultimate, BF method is less dependent on claims experience to date  

\- **C**an be difficult to gather the information for the prior estimate for the claims  

### Strengths and weaknesses of ACPC - Ch 13 - EVIL DOS DIRS

\+ **E**asy to understand and communicate  
\+ **V**olatile data and result can be helped to explain when data contains only a small number of claims  
\+ **I**nformation provided on how both claim numbers and claim amounts are expected to develop in the future  
\+ **L**atent claims estimation basis  

\+ **D**ata is generally available, for direct business in particular  
\+ **O**ther projection methods can be used in conjunction, e.g. chain ladder and BF  
\+ **S**ettled claims can have ACPC applied when claims reserving policies have changed over development history, which make some other methods invalid  

\- **D**istribution of claims assumed to be the same for each origin year or settlement year  
\- **I**nformation needed which is more detailed and may not be available  
\- **R**eopened / nil / partial payment claims may distort results  
\- **S**mall data samples may lead to volatile results
